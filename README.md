Process of Compiling and Running the Code:
 
1. Writing the Code: The code is written in the C++ programming language.
2. Compilation: When the user clicks the "Run" button, the editor compiles the C++ code into machine code, which is the language that the computer's processor understands.
3. Execution: After compilation, the editor executes the compiled machine code. This means the processor reads the instructions and performs the tasks specified in the code, which is printing the text to the console.
